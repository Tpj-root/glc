alias - customised shortcut for commands

$ sudo alias name="value"

create a user klug with home directory then,

$ sudo alias cd="cd /home/klug"
root@klug:~# cd
root@klug:/home/klug

Note:
cd is a shell builtin, not an external system command
Using the same alias name for cd is allowed, but it can cause confusion or unexpected behavior if not handled properly.
To avoid issues with aliasing built-in commands like cd, use these best practices:

Use a different alias name:

$ alias gohome='cd /home/klug'


$ sudo alias d="df -Th"

root@klug:~# d


To print all the defined aliases is reusable format
# alias -p


Make it persistent:
Add the alias to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc, then run source ~/.bashrc

Run source ~/.bashrc (or ~/.zshrc) → immediately applies changes.

Or close and reopen the terminal → shell reads the config file on startup.

Use source if you want the alias active right away without restarting the terminal.

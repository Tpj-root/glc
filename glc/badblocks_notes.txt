badblocks - search a device for bad blocks


By default it doesnâ€™t display any output on the screen, when there
are no bad blocks as shown below.
$ sudo badblocks /dev/sda1


To view the badblocks search in verbose mode i.e how much scanning
it has done so far
$ sudo badblocks -v /dev/sda1


By default it uses 1024 as block size , we specify a block size
using -b option
$ sudo badblocks -v -b 2048 /dev/sda1


To Specify Maximum Bad Blocks Count to 100
$ sudo badblocks -v -e 100 /dev/sda1


Write the Badblocks to a File
$ sudo badblocks -v -o badblocks.log /dev/sdb1


To Perform a Badblock Write Mode Test
$ sudo badblocks -vw /dev/sda1


To display current progress of the test
$ sudo badblocks -s /dev/sda1


To specify the number of blocks to be tested at a time ,the
default is 64 blocks.
$sudo badblocks -sc 2000 /dev/sda1


To write the list of badblocks to a file rather than on standard
output
$ sudo badblocks -o out.txt /dev/sda1


To provide an input file which contains a list of known bad blocks
in device, it will skip the known bad blocks at the time of test
$ sudo badblocks -i known-badblocks.txt /dev/sda1


To perform a non-destructive read-write test on device,
$ sudo badblocks -sn /dev/sda1


To test blocks from the first block to the specified last block
$ sudo badblocks -s /dev/sda1 2000



It is specified by passing the starting block number to test as an
option after last block.
$ sudo badblocks -s /dev/sda1 2000 200

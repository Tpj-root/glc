check-bios-nx - determine if BIOS has blocked CPU's NX
capabilities

NX stands for No eXecute is a technology used in processors to
prevent the execution of certain types of code


This program attempts to determine if the running x86-based CPU
has NX capabilities

If the CPU is NX-capable but the nx bit is missing from flags,
exit 1 otherwise exit 0 (nothing wrong with BIOS)


$ sudo check-bios-nx --verbose
ok: the NX bit is operational on this CPU.

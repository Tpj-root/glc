cksum - checksum and count the bytes in a file
cksum command in Linux is used to display a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) value



CRC is unique for each file and only changes if the file is edited


$ cksum file.txt
2410262730 15 file.txt



after transfer of file.txt to other device or location

check with cksum
$ cksum file.txt
2410262730 15 file.txt
CRC value is same hence the file is not corrupted or edited

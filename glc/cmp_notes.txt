cmp - compare two files byte by byte


cmp command reports the byte and line number if a difference is found
$ cmp file1.txt file2.txt


To display the differing bytes in the output
$ cmp -b file1.txt file2.txt


To skip a particular number of initial bytes from both the files
$ cmp -i 100 file1.txt file2.txt


To input the number of bytes we want to skip
$ cmp -i 100:120 file1.txt file2.txt


To print byte position and byte value for all differing bytes
$ cmp -l file1.txt file2.txt


To limit the number of bytes we want to compare
$ cmp -n 500 file1.txt file2.txt

CRUNCH(1)                   General Commands Manual                  CRUNCH(1)

NAME
       crunch - generate wordlists from a character set

SYNOPSIS
       crunch <min-len> <max-len> [<charset string>] [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Crunch can create a wordlist based on criteria you specify.  The output
       from crunch can be sent to the screen, file,  or  to  another  program.
       The required parameters are:

       min-len
              The minimum length string you want crunch to start at.  This op‐
              tion is required even for parameters that won't use the value.

       max-len
              The maximum length string you want crunch to end at.   This  op‐
              tion is required even for parameters that won't use the value.

       charset string
              You  may specify character sets for crunch to use on the command
              line or if you leave it blank crunch will use the default  char‐
              acter sets.  The order MUST BE lower case characters, upper case
              characters, numbers, and then symbols.  If you don't follow this
              order  you  will not get the results you want.  You MUST specify
              either values for the character type or a plus sign.   NOTE:  If
              you  want  to  include the space character in your character set
              you must escape it using the \ character or enclose your charac‐
              ter  set in quotes i.e. "abc ".  See the examples 3, 11, 12, and
              13 for examples.

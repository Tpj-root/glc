fakeroot - fakeroot runs a command in an environment wherein it
appears to have root privileges for file manipulation. 
This is useful for allowing users to create archives (tar, ar, .deb etc.) with files in them with root permissions/ownership



$ fakeroot
# echo "fake root access given" > root.txt
# ls -l root.txt
# ls -l /root
# exit
$ ls -l root.txt

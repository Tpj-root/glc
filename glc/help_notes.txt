The glc command provides usage instructions, installation steps, and examples 
— even when man pages are not available. 
It’s a quick reference guide right in your terminal.

The shell searches possible matches based on what you typed.
If one match, it auto-completes it.

If multiple matches, it either:

    Shows you the list of matches (on second Tab press), or
    Completes up to the common prefix.

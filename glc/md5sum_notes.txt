md5sum - it is designed to create, read, and check file integrity using MD5


$ cat example.txt
this is line one
this is line two



To display the file hash value alongside the filename
$ md5sum [filename]
$ md5sum example.txt


To read the file in binary mode
$ md5sum -b example.txt


To read the file in text mode
$ md5sum -t example.txt


To create a BSD-style checksum with -tag
$ md5sum --tag example.txt


To check a file by comparing its hash value with the value
provided in a hash file
$ cat example.txt
this is line one
this is line two



To store the MD5 checksum for example.txt in file checkmd5.md5
$ md5sum example.txt > checkmd5.md5296


To check the contents of file
$ md5sum -c checkmd5.md5
example.txt: OK



After changing the contents of file
$ echo "Hai" >> example.txt
$ md5sum -c checkmd5.md5
example.txt: FAILED
md5sum: WARNING: 1 computed checksum did NOT match



To create a BSD-style checksum with tag option
$ md5sum --tag test.txt


To validate multiple files
$ md5sum file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt > hashfile



To check the integrity of above multiple files
$ md5sum -c hashfile
change the content of any one above file for eg. file2.txt and
check


To display only modified files
$ md5sum --quiet -c hashfile
